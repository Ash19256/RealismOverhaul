//Experimental Landing Engine
//VSR
//========================================================
//Cosmonaut Crash Space Agency Experimental Landing Engine

//Dimensions: 2.81 meters long, 1.63 meters in diameter, derived from LR-91
//Gross Mass: Assumed 750 kg, to acknowledge increases in chamber pressure and changes to cooling system relative to LR-91,
//as well as gimballing and deep throttling capability.
//Throttle Range: 25% to 100% percent, for use as a landing engine
//Rated Burn Time: 480 seconds in initial configuration
//Fuel/Oxidizer Ratio: 1.86
//Cost: Twice that of a normal LR-91
